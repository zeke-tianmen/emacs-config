* Org mode & c++ projects
** Org mode and C++ projects fit together beautifully once you wire them up with the right structure. What you get is a living engineering notebook that stays in sync with your codebase, supports literate snippets, captures design decisions, and even drives builds or tests directly from Org.
** Why Org + C++ works *so* well

    - centralized project notes: architecture, TODOs, design patterns, benchmarks

    - literate code blocks: embed C++ snippets that tangle into real .cpp files

    - task tracking: link TODOs directly to source files

    - jump-to-source links: Org links that open .cpp or .h at exact lines

    - build/test integration: run CMake, Ninja, tests from inside Org

    - export to HTML/PDF: produce design docs automatically

** This is the kind of workflow senior engineers use to keep large C++ systems coherent.
